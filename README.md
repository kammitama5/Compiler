# Compiler
Long-term repo for building a new language and eventually a compiler

Step one:
1. Make a language 
   Think of: words (keywords)
             Numbers and evaluation of numbers (Order of operation)
             Functions 
             
             
2. Once the rules of the language have been established, 
   formulate parser (diagram, how will be evaluated -> depth first, etc)
   
3. I'd ideally like to build a C++ compiler, but at this time, it's best to start in Python
